# Citibike Analytics with Tableau

## Overview

Welcome to the Citibike Analytics project powered by Tableau! This project explores Citibike data to uncover insights into trip patterns, peak hours, and the impact of external factors like COVID-19 on Citibike usage.

## Key Features

- **Trip Patterns:** Spatial and temporal distribution of Citibike trips.
- **Peak Hours:** Visual representation of the busiest hours for Citibike usage.
- **Year-on-Year Comparison:** Analyze changes in Citibike usage between 2019 and 2020.

## Data Source
The initial stage of the project involved acquiring all the monthly CSV files, covering the period from January 2019 to December 2020, from the [Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) Data webpage and organizing them in a designated folder named "Data". The data used in this analysis specifically pertains to the Jersey City region.

Subsequently, I established a python program, named "combine_csv.py", to systematically clean and combine all the monthly CSV files into a single CSV file, in preparation for importing into Tableau.
